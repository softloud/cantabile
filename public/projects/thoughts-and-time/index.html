<h2>my current systems</h2>
<p>Updated: 2018-08-16</p>
<p>I wonder if all or some of this should move to the <code>dontpanic</code> readme.</p>
<div id="pieces" class="section level3">
<h3>pieces</h3>
<ul>
<li>piano practice/task switching/pomodoor</li>
<li>bullet journal, used to be as portable as possible</li>
<li>blog to see if I’ve made any progress on my study problems for today, to track my productivity system, and to learn about my research problems; in short, blog for me, don’t worry about anyone else: but keep it to those three categories; one category per post, etc.</li>
<li>googleverse for mail, calendar, etc.</li>
<li>index cards for subprojects and github issues</li>

<div id="my-bullet-journal" class="section level3">
<h3>my bullet journal</h3>
<p>Rather suddenly, about a year ago, I became someone who travels <em>all the time</em>. I just got back from Seattle, and that was my eighteenth trip in the last year.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how long this phase of my life will last, maybe just for another few months, but I do know it’s not going away yet. Now that we’ve moved to Bendigo, anyway, just going to Melbourne is a bit of a journey.</p>
<p>I like pen and paper because I am never limited by the system. I can write mathematics, plan a talk, take some notes. I like that everything is chronologically bundled.</p>
<p>I have rather enthusiastically adopted signifiers.</p>
<p>My system prioritises <em>how</em> I spend my time. So, my first priority is to achieve a balance between my doctorate, skill building, and everything else.</p>
</div>
<div id="signifiers" class="section level3">
<h3>signifiers</h3>
<div id="priority" class="section level4">
<h4>priority</h4>
<p>I’ve been using priority signifiers too loosely.</p>
<p>I think <code>*</code> should indicate do something <em>today</em> or really bad things happen.</p>
<p>Perhaps I’ll try <code>~</code> to indicate I’m feeling anxious about this, so it will make me feel better to progress it today.</p>
</div>
<div id="projects" class="section level4">
<h4>projects</h4>
<p>Functional harmony + figured bass, which has always been my chord chart nomenclature preference.</p>
<p>So, <span class="math inline">\(\text I^6\)</span> would indicate the instantiation of a <strong>major</strong>, or significant, project for the day, and <span class="math inline">\(\text i^6\)</span> for a <strong>minor</strong> project. For each subsequent action or tast associated with the project, root postion rather than first inversion <span class="math inline">\(\text I\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\text i\)</span>.</p>
<p>Major projects are to be prioritised over minor projects. Don’t have more than three main projects at a time. Actions can always be paused with a <em>fermata</em>.</p>

<h2>reviews</h2>
<p>I was reading in Cal Newport’s blog about <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2018/05/17/ready-player-productive-on-virtual-reality-and-cognitively-demanding-work/">location-based cognition</a>.</p>
<p>To add to that, I think ritual helps a lot, too. Having some things I do without fail each day when I sit down. I try to develop an association with my tools: laptop, black felt-tip pen, ruler, bujo, pipemouse, index cards, and sticky notes.</p>
<p>I can’t control my location, but by surrounding myself by these tools, it can feel <em>locally</em> familiar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>todo: dig out that locally euclidean picture of euclid in the skate ramp</p>

<div id="daily" class="section level3">
<h3>daily</h3>
<ul>
<li>Check <strong>calendar</strong>.</li>
<li>Possibly read over for typos, then push <strong>blogpost</strong> and create today’s post and write anything, even if it is only one sentence.</li>
<li>What is on <strong>fire</strong>?</li>
<li>Draw a <strong>project tracker</strong>. (Still haven’t settled on a model.)</li>
<li>Add one <strong>weekly review task</strong> to today’s list.</li>
<li>Morning kitchen tidy, if at <span class="math inline">\(3c^2\)</span>.</li>
<li>Weekdays: put away <strong>laundry</strong> if at <span class="math inline">\(3c^2\)</span>.</li>
<li>Choose three github issue index cards for PhD.</li>
<li>Update <strong>index cards</strong> with GitHub issues. (Perhaps all monthly projects should be GitHub repos.)</li>
</ul>

<div id="weekly" class="section level3">
<h3>weekly</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>unless there’s a compelling reason, do it on paper</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will likely need refinement, but the idea is it’s easier to focus with pen and paper. Also,</p>
<p>Exceptions due to compelling reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>gcal: I tried the paper-based system and it drove me nuts. I had to constantly transer events other people set from my calendars.</li>
<li>blog: I type a lot faster than I write. Also I get a sore shoulder really quickly.</li>

<div id="some-history" class="section level2">
<h2>some history</h2>
<p>At the webinar launch of <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/introducing-r-ladies-remote-chapter/">rladies remote</a> in early 2018, and subsequent slack hangout, it was interesting how the topic of time management dominated throughout.</p>
<p>A particular shared experience was the challenge of not just working, but being <em>motivated</em> to work continuously and consistently, when working remotely or in isolation of some description.</p>
<p>Now, I may be a relative newcomer to statistics and data science, having only taken an interest during my doctorate, but I am deeply experienced the above struggle.</p>
<p>In a previous life, I spent almost twenty years supporting myself as a freelance pianist (mostly accompanying work) and a piano teacher.</p>
<p>Imagine having to motivate yourself like that, and not even getting paid well? Without heating? Living in hellhole rentals with exploitative landlords?</p>
<p>So I researched everything I could get my hands on. I made so, so many mistakes, and wasted extraordinary amounts of time. I learned that I have an infinite talent for procrastination, and that inspiration does not spring as Metis from Zeus’ head (yes, Felix, if you ever read this, that was a <em>gallah!</em> reference.)</p>
<p>Thing is, I’m a bit of a hedonist, and I think life should be for savouring, not doing boring stuff. Without motivating myself somewhat, I wasn’t going to escape the physical discomfort of poverty.</p>
<p>I looked into, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">getting things done</a> (or g.t.d.) system <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoro</a> time-keeping system</li>
<li>Cal Newport’s <a href="http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/"><em>Deep Work</em></a></li>
<li>I used <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">omnifocus</a> for about a decade, but ultimately found I was managing my todo lists, and not my life.</li>
<li>flash card software</li>
<li>various mindmapping software</li>
<li>curio, pinboards, evernote, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Curiously, there’s a great deal of overlap in the commonsense shared between self-help productivity and conventional music teacher’s practice instructions. In both cases, you must return to the task unendingly, ever getting better, but ever moving current projects towards completion. There’s a balance between the two.</p>
<p>In twenty years of watching other people struggle with maintaining a practice routine, it is my impression that the single biggest motivator for everyone is simply booking the time and sitting down. Also, breaking the problem into small and achievable tasks.</p>
<p>Also, and it’s not for nothing, having most people treat you like a nanny who never got a “real job”. The indignity that went along with the profession, and with being a streetkid, has felt like the perfect preparation for a situation where you get little external validation.</p>
<p>So, instead I returned to what I’d learnt from practicing - and failing to practice - piano for twenty-five years. What worked, and what did I know didn’t work? I thought it would be easier to get around things that didn’t work with something new, rather than another musical instrument (although I was of two minds for a while, so I bought a cello.) It has been easier. There were patterns I knew were unhelpful but kept doing in piano, because they were familiar.</p>
<p>What really brought it together for me was reading sCal Newport’s <em>Deep Work</em>. He makes the good point that, we have variable lives, so why have <em>one</em> productivity system.</p>
<p>Something that I am working on, however, is finishing the review lists I come up with for myself. I am threading my daily log well, and that does seem to help an awful lot, but I am not finishing my daily review. Since, by definition, it is meant to be the list of things I cannot possibly pass the day without doing, there is something not working. I am also woefully behind on email, and I hate that.</p>
