      <description># packages library(tidyverse) # What  Write a purrr::rerun simulation So, I suppose we want to create a meta-analysis.
We need to take two samples
Try it with the single-study setting first In this case we wish to produce trials worth of samples.
Calculate the confidence intervals.
The function n = 3 trials = 10   Evaluation of functions   </description>
