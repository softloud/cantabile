      <description>I’ve been toying around with what I was trying to achieve with my original ideas about &amp;lt;&amp;gt;.
Various suggestions bounced around last time. Adam Gruer came up with this awesome solution. But the problem has nagged at me that I didn’t do a good job of articulating myself last time.
Here’s what I realised I want.
I want a fast, lightweight way of conveying the gist of a tidy algorithm to someone else.</description>

      <description>This post follows on from the post I wrote leading up to the workshop.
What I found myself jonesing for at the workshop last week was an environment called quack-quack that would output coloured pseudocode.
There was much feedback from the workshop last week along the lines of it being great to have more autonomy in the learning process. But I feel without clearer delineation the pseudo code isn’t quite there.</description>

      <description>I’m currently working on R-Curious, a workshop hosted by R-Ladies.
Something that bothers me about workshop convention is the trap of copy and paste code. I want to develop a system of pseudo code that is easily discernable by newbies. I wonder if something like this already exists?
As a piano teacher, I found it was dramatic how important it was to make sure the student was doing, thinking for themselves.</description>
