      <description>Today, I talk at the AMSI Choose Maths Day at La Trobe.
I’ve been giving a bunch of career-oriented outreach talks about the concept of ikigai, a purpose for being, a reason to get out of bed.
I like to replace do what you’re good at with do what you enjoy getting good at.
Seemed like time to put some slides together. I’m cutting down on the number of bullet points, but I’m not sure I’m ready to go with just visuals, like I saw Kara rock at Seattle RLadies.</description>
