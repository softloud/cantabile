      <description>I believe that all people struggle with adulting, and that no one is perfect. Although my lifetime has shaped me as noticably different to many people, for the first time in a long while I feel I’ve been able to make use of my strengths.
 never been so proud #choosemaths https://t.co/8gptuDY4Dy — Charles T.

Seemed like time to put some slides together. I’m cutting down on the number of bullet points, but I’m not sure I’m ready to go with just visuals, like I saw Kara rock at Seattle RLadies.</description>
