      <description>I’m writing my first tests at the moment.
I’ve been rather enamoured with the idea of testing for about six months now, but haven’t had much of a chance to work on research.

I recently saw Kara Woo speak at R-Ladies Seattle, and she made a compelling case for debugging with rigour.</description>
