      <description>I’m writing my first tests at the moment.
I’ve been rather enamoured with the idea of testing for about six months now, but haven’t had much of a chance to work on research.
So, I’m finally now sitting down to begin my first package in earnest, and thus writing my first tests. Seeing as I had a request, I thought I’d write my thoughts at this fairly early point. I must confess, however, that this post wandered around a bit and I’m not sure how useful John would find it, alas; it’s not really an explanatory post, more of an exploration.</description>
