      <description># packages library(tidyverse) # What  Write a purrr::rerun simulation So, I suppose we want to create a meta-analysis.
We need to take two samples
Try it with the single-study setting first In this case we wish to produce trials worth of samples.
Calculate the confidence intervals.

      <description>This post follows on from the post I wrote leading up to the workshop.
What I found myself jonesing for at the workshop last week was an environment called quack-quack that would output coloured pseudocode.
There was much feedback from the workshop last week along the lines of it being great to have more autonomy in the learning process. But I feel without clearer delineation the pseudo code isn’t quite there.</description>

      <description>I’m currently working on R-Curious, a workshop hosted by R-Ladies.
Something that bothers me about workshop convention is the trap of copy and paste code. I want to develop a system of pseudo code that is easily discernable by newbies. I wonder if something like this already exists?
As a piano teacher, I found it was dramatic how important it was to make sure the student was doing, thinking for themselves.</description>
