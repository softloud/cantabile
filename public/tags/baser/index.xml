      <description># packages library(tidyverse) The good ol’ apply functions I first met this class in my true isolation days. I was on scholarship at a biomedical institute where it felt like nobody thought a second-year university student should be thus polluting their shades.
I want to know how the function and its arguments can be vecorised.
Should I be experimenting with a list or with a tibble? Let’s try a tibble first, hopefully I’m right in thinking of it as a special type of list.</description>
