         <p>You know, I am not surprised one whit by the success of the men’s sheds movement</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://mensshed.org/about-amsa/what-is-amsa/">whose primary activity is the provision of a safe, friendly and healing environment where men are able to work on meaningful projects at their own pace in their own time in the company of other men</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and where</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“men don’t talk face to face(,) they talk shoulder to shoulder.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently worked on a scraping algorithm component for a larger project with a couple of ecologists. I got stumped on a really, really specific thing, and posted a question to the R-Ladies forum. Jenny Bryan was extraordinarily helpful, and I learnt a great deal from the project. It was thrilling to do real research with real scientists, and it really did feel we all were having a smashing time of it. This project is a follow-on from the <a href="https://evidencesynthesishackathon.com/">Evidence Synthesis Hackathon</a>.</p>
<p>I was so buoyed by the normalising effect of the ecologists’ company, and the newfound community of R-Ladies, I got more mathematics done that week than I had for months.</p>
<p>I recently wrote about how I use work to cope.
One way I facilitate this is to engage in professional societies; I enjoy talking about tools, statistics, mathematics, and programming. Thus, I enjoy socialising and working on projects with people who enjoy those things, too. Some people join a fishing club, or a men’s shed<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Since the events leading up to the <a href="http://cantabile.rbind.io/2018/07/18/crying-should-be-okay/">eponymous crying</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, I have experienced several interactions where I have been excluded from discussions and decisions that pertained to me, as well as projects within some organisations with whom I am affiliated.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that people are well intentioned to the hilt. But removing one of the most useful tools for coping with c-ptsd that I have seems like an awfully strange way of helping me out.</p>
<p>And think of the implicit message, that you believe that I am incapable of making rational decisions for myself? Permit me to drop some knowledge from the school of hard knocks, that type of power imbalance is a recipe for a toxic relationship. Furthermore, the silence that accompanies making decisions for other people renders the issue seemingly taboo.</p>
<p>If we’re really commited to diversity, then it needs to begin and end with agency. It is a dark world, indeed, where we feel we can unilaterally decide for another person was is within their capabilities or to their benefit or detriment.</p>
<p>I will be stepping aside from organisations that do not privilege agency, as I believe respecting others’ agency is the one of the foremost ways we demonstrate fundamental respect for another person. I will now prioritise organisations<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> who welcome and nuture those who find healing through their engagement with the shared interests within the community. I will find my own figurtive men’s sheds.</p>
<p>Through my tears, some time back, I asked a male friend, “is this how it happens?” Is this how women get driven out of data science?</p>
<p>You fucking betcha.</p>
