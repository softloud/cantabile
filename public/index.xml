      <description>Had a good chat to the ever helpful Miles about git yesterday. A good follow-up from the unconf where I cornered Jenny and pestered her with questions. I think I’m starting to understand things a bit better.
Anyway, no better place to try things out than the blog, which I assume no one reads :)
create branch git checkout &amp;lt;branch-name&amp;gt;^1 make changes commit git commit -m &amp;quot;&amp;lt;some-message&amp;gt;&amp;quot; push git push merge by pull request on github  So, how to integrate this with a blogging workflow.</description>

      <description>Today, I talk at the AMSI Choose Maths Day at La Trobe.
I’ve been giving a bunch of career-oriented outreach talks about the concept of ikigai, a purpose for being, a reason to get out of bed.
I like to replace do what you’re good at with do what you enjoy getting good at.
Seemed like time to put some slides together. I’m cutting down on the number of bullet points, but I’m not sure I’m ready to go with just visuals, like I saw Kara rock at Seattle RLadies.</description>

      <description>Ever in search of inbox zen, I’m hoping to plough through my daily review today.
I am still failing to finish it. I think I’m falling into the trap of making gcal too complicated and too big a part of my workflow.
I think I’ll try erring towards writing with pen and paper whenever I have a choice.
Often I plan a talk better with pen and paper. I think I think clearer.</description>

      <description>Is it better to work every morning and knock off early? Or is it better to take rest days and work longer during the week? I’m still not sure.
Today is a rest day, and I’m going to colonise Mars.</description>

      <description>Day two, and I’ve managed to to at least remember to create the .Rmd file and write a sentence.
 Try writing every day and see if it has a measurable positive effect.
 I’m catching the train the numbats today, going to see if I can get more done on the train.
Visited numbats group today to see Hugh Parsonage’s talk. He was visiting from the Grattan institute and he showed us how they were working with R to provide reports on policy and so forth.</description>

      <description>If you’ve spent any time around me at all, you’ll know that work is a coping mechanism for me.
This blog is less about other people and more about keeping myself grounded through semi-regular posts. I’d say I’d aim for one a day, but honestly, one a month would probably be pushing it.
That being said, I think I’ll try for every day for a little while. So, I guess I should add it to the daily review.</description>

      <description>my current systems Updated: 2018-06-12
I wonder if all or some of this should move to the dontpanic readme.
pieces  piano practice/task switching/pomodoor bullet journal, used to be as portable as possible blog to see if I’ve made any progress on my study problems for today, to track my productivity system, and to learn about my research problems; in short, blog for me, don’t worry about anyone else: but keep it to those three categories; one category per post, etc.</description>
