      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve moved house twice in the last year and it&amp;rsquo;s taken a toll. In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;m still working on my doctorate in, for want of a formal term, statistical data science. A tidy statistician, perhaps.
I need to muster all my tools for keeping sane as I weather the aftershocks of the housing crisis with this newfound stabiltiy.
I think blogging daily will help me organise my thoughts. I suspect it&amp;rsquo;ll be too introspective to be worth subscribing to.</description>

I need to muster all my tools for keeping sane as I weather the aftershocks of the housing affordability crisis with this newfound stabiltiy.
I think blogging daily regularly will help me organise my thoughts.</description>
