# work can be so much fun

how do *you* like to spend your day?

let's rethink **do what you love** advice

**not**: ~~what do you like?~~ but, *how* do you want to spend your day?

# the maths brain myth

what if I did maths like a I do music?

## from a musician's point of view

mathematicians don't think about equations first, they solve problems

musicians don't think about the notes, they *hear* the music

# my ikigai

### what you love 

**this** is how I like to spend my day

### what the world needs 

ecological research, cancer

### what you can get paid for 

**statistics** and **data science** are highly sought after skills   

### what you're good at

creativity + mathematics, ftw!

# my ikigai

One of my favourite things is to take boring-looking data like this...

```{r echo = TRUE}
iris %>% 
  head()
```

---
# my ikigai

...and turn that data into a pretty picture that tells us interesting scientific information.

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=4, width =3}
iris %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = Species)) +
  labs(title = "iris petal width compared to petal length")

```

# what's your ikigai?

### what you love 

*how do you like to spend your time?* 

### what the world needs 

*want to save the world?*

### what you can get paid for 

*why not choose something with lots of options?*

### what you're good at 

*do you like puzzles?*

# what's your ikigai?

could your ikigai involve **mathematics**? 

do you want to help **save the world**?
