<p>Ever in search of inbox zen, I’m hoping to plough through my daily review today.</p>
<p>I am still failing to finish it. I think I’m falling into the trap of making gcal too complicated and too big a part of my workflow.</p>
<p>I think I’ll try erring towards writing with pen and paper whenever I have a choice.</p>
<p>Often I plan a talk better with pen and paper. I think I think clearer.</p>
<p>There’s also the problem of todo apps taking up valuable screen space that I need for rstudio and github and twitter and so forth.</p>
<p>Most of my posting today will be done in the project document on my current project management system.</p>
