<p>If you’ve spent any time around me at all, you’ll know that work is a coping mechanism for me.</p>
<p>This blog is less about other people and more about keeping myself grounded through semi-regular posts. I’d say I’d aim for one a day, but honestly, one a month would probably be pushing it.</p>
<p>That being said, I think I’ll try for every day for a little while. <del>So, I guess I should add it to the daily review.</del></p>

<p>Revisit blogposts in a week: helpful, or just another thing to fail at getting around to?</p>

<h2>What did I want to get out of this blog?</h2>
<p>I’m always trying out productivity systems, so I wanted somewhere I could reflect on my systems.</p>
<p>I also need to do a lot of learning on my own, so somewhere I can organise my thoughts and plans. Perhaps it’s time to understand how gant charts work (but only in my spare time!)</p>
<p>Finally, I also do a lot of teaching and talking, so I don’t see why I can’t have these categories as well. Let’s see how it goes.</p>

<div id="index-cards-for-github-issues" class="section level2">
<h2>Index cards for GitHub issues</h2>
<p>Today I’m trying out using index cards with github issues on them. To motivate myself to do some work. Doesn’t matter which card I’m on, just try one card at a time until pom is done.</p>
<p>Working with everything.</p>
