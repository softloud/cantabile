<p>Today, I talk at the AMSI <a href="https://choosemaths.org.au/">Choose Maths</a> Day at La Trobe.</p>
<p>I’ve been giving a bunch of career-oriented outreach talks about the concept of <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-japanese-concept-of-ikigai-why-purpose-might-be-a-better-goal-than-happiness-88709"><em>ikigai</em></a>, a purpose for being, a reason to get out of bed.</p>
<p>I like to replace <em>do what you’re good at</em> with <em>do what you enjoy getting good at</em>.</p>
<p>Seemed like time to put some <a href="https://github.com/softloud/outreach/blob/master/talks/ikigai.Rmd">slides</a> together. I’m cutting down on the number of bullet points, but I’m not sure I’m ready to go with just visuals, like I saw Kara rock at Seattle RLadies.</p>
<hr />
<p>I definitely didn’t prepare enough for this talk. I think it was a bit garbled. I do like my slides, however. So, that’s an improvement on the last time. Must practice talks all the way through. It was hubris!</p>
