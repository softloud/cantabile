<p><em>This post follows on from the <a href="../post/2018-06-17-a-coding-workshop-without-code.html">post</a> I wrote leading up to the workshop.</em></p>
<p>What I found myself jonesing for at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/rladies-sydney/events/251387926/">workshop</a> last week was an environment called <code>quack-quack</code> that would output coloured pseudocode.</p>
<p>There was much feedback from the workshop last week along the lines of it being great to have more autonomy in the learning process. But I feel without clearer delineation the pseudo code isn’t quite there.</p>
<p>Something that begins with ```<code>{quack-quack A pseudo code chunk.}</code> perhaps.</p>
<p>Maybe an add-in that produces a chunk-like environment with toggle-on-off instructions:</p>
<pre><code># This isn&#39;t code that is intended to be copied and pasted into your console. 

# This is pseudo code, designed to illustrate the structure of the syntax, so that you can extend your idea as needed. Learn more &lt;here&gt;.

</code></pre>
<p>and then <code>here</code> took you to a page with something along the lines of the following:</p>
<p>This pseudo code is designed to illustrate the structure of the syntax. You will need to adapt the code indicated by <code>&lt;some pseudo code&gt;</code> to your specific problem and data for you code to work. [Right now I’m indicating this as <code>&lt;&gt;</code> but I’d be interested to see if it’s easy to implement font and colour that makes it stand out more.]</p>
<ul>
<li>We always call data <code>some_dataset</code> and a second dataset is <code>another_dataset</code>. These are coloured <some colour>. Functions are coloured <some colour> and so forth. I mean, code does this all the time, right?</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid break stuff and mess about.</li>
<li>Some more stuff, maybe.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code># Example pseudo code.

&lt;some_dataset&gt; %&gt;%  
  ggplot(aes(x = &lt;column name&gt;, y = &lt;column name&gt;)) +
  geom_point() # Adds a scatterplot.</code></pre>
<p>I still struggle to write pseudocode in a way that is informative and not confusing. Not sure what to put between the quack-quacks <code>&lt;&gt;</code> here. I <em>do</em> like the term <em>quack-quack</em>, though. And the feedback at the workshop seemed to be positive, so I think I’ll hang onto the idea for a while and play around with it in my teaching.</p>
<p>It’d be nice if the chunk formatted in the same way that it looks in the editor pane, but with the colours - in both the editor and the html. I wonder if such a thing were easy?</p>

<p>My film music playlist from the start, shuffle off. As I write this, I’m up to that track from <em>The Last of Us</em>; there is some sublime game music coming out now.</p>
