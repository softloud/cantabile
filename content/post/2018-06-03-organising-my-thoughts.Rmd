Ever in search of inbox zen, I'm hoping to plough through my daily review today.

I am still failing to finish it. I think I'm falling into the trap of making gcal too complicated and too big a part of my workflow.

I think I'll try erring towards writing with pen and paper whenever I have a choice. 

Often I plan a talk better with pen and paper. I think I think clearer. 

There's also the problem of todo apps taking up valuable screen space that I need for rstudio and github and twitter and so forth. 

Most of my posting today will be done in the project document on my current project management system.
