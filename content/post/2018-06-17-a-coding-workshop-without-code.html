<p>I’m currently working on <a href="https://github.com/softloud/rcurious">R-Curious</a>, a workshop hosted by <a href="https://rladies.org/">R-Ladies</a>.</p>
<p>Something that bothers me about workshop convention is the trap of copy and paste code. I want to develop a system of pseudo code that is easily discernable by newbies. I wonder if something like this already exists?</p>
<p>As a piano teacher, I found it was dramatic how important it was to make sure the student was doing, thinking for themselves.</p>
<p>For example, I think there is a difference betwen presenting new R coders with</p>
<pre><code>install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>install.packages(&quot;arbitrary-package&quot;)

# Now let&#39;s try to install a package called &quot;tidyverse&quot;</code></pre>
<p>I have seem people beside me at workshops run code and declare they have learnt a great deal. However, simply running someone else’s code only demonstrates that they know how to write it and you know how to run it.</p>
<p>As an educator, I think this is the question that has most interested me in the last six years of lecturing and speaking. I don’t have a solution, but I’m going to experiment with how <em>little</em> prescriptive code I can have in my workshop.</p>
<p>In a workshop environment, can’t we all use cheatsheets and tutorials, just as we do when we are working alone? Why not have searching for solutions online be part of the workshop?</p>
<p>But now I fret that not everyone will have internet access.</p>
