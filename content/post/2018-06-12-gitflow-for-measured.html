<p>Had a good chat to the ever helpful Miles about git yesterday. A good follow-up from the unconf where I cornered Jenny and pestered her with questions. I think Iâ€™m starting to understand things a bit better.</p>
<p>Anyway, no better place to try things out than the blog, which I assume no one reads :)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>create branch <code>git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt; ?</code></li>
<li>make changes</li>
<li>commit</li>
<li>push</li>
<li>merge by pull request on github</li>
</ol>
<p>So, how to integrate this with a blogging workflow. Might start half-way through and review post from yesterday.</p>
