<p>Had a good chat to the ever helpful Miles about git yesterday. A good follow-up from the unconf where I cornered Jenny and pestered her with questions. I think I’m starting to understand things a bit better.</p>
<p>Anyway, no better place to try things out than the blog, which I assume no one reads :)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>create branch <code>git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;</code><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>make changes</li>
<li>stage <code>git add .</code> and commit <code>git commit -m &quot;&lt;some-message&gt;&quot;</code></li>
<li>push <code>git push</code></li>
<li>merge by pull request <strong>on github</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>So, how to integrate this with a blogging workflow. Might start half-way through and review post from yesterday.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I think this works. Technically I think it’s for switching branches, but I think switching to a new branch implicitly instantiates the branch.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
</ol>
