Had a good chat to the ever helpful Miles about git yesterday. A good follow-up from the unconf where I cornered Jenny and pestered her with questions. I think I'm starting to understand things a bit better.

Anyway, no better place to try things out than the blog, which I assume no one reads :) 

1. create branch `git checkout <branch-name> ?`
2. make changes
3. commit 
4. push
5. merge by pull request on github

So, how to integrate this with a blogging workflow. Might start half-way through and review post from yesterday.
