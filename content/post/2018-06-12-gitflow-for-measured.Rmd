Had a good chat to the ever helpful Miles about git yesterday. A good follow-up from the unconf where I cornered Jenny and pestered her with questions. I think I'm starting to understand things a bit better.

Anyway, no better place to try things out than the blog, which I assume no one reads :) 

1. create branch `git checkout -b <branch-name>`[^1]
2. make changes
3. stage `git add .` and commit `git commit -m "<some-message>"`
4. push `git push origin <branch-name>`
5. merge by pull request **on github**

So, how to integrate this with a blogging workflow. Might start half-way through and review post from yesterday.   

[^1]: I think this works. Technically I think it's for switching branches, but I think switching to a new branch implicitly instantiates the branch.
