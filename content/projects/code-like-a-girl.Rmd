I recently teamed up with [code like a girl](https://codelikeagirl.org/) for a series of Data Storytelling presentations around Australia. Here's a link list of some of the resources mentioned. The [slide presentation](http://cantabile.rbind.io/talks/clg/slides) also has a lot of links to check out, too.
