```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## get the data

```{r}
cats_vs_dogs <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018-09-11/cats_vs_dogs.csv")

```

```{r}
cats_vs_dogs %>%  skimr::skim()
```

There are 49 unique states, so they'll do as a row identifier for the original format. Also seems like a worthy way of considering the data. Is there a difference between states? 

```{r}
cats_vs_dogs <- cats_vs_dogs %>% 
  select(-X1)
```

No missing values, so that's nice. 

So, what questions do I have? Do different states have differing numbers of cats and dogs? Is pet ownership the same everywhere? 

This has a lot of count data. Perhaps one of those block emoji patterns. I need to take a look at a vis reference.
