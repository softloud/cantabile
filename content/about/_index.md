I've moved house twice in the last year and it's taken a toll. In the meantime, I'm still working on my doctorate in, for want of a formal term, statistical data science. A tidy statistician, perhaps. 

I need to muster all my tools for keeping sane as I weather the aftershocks of the housing crisis with this newfound stabiltiy. 

I think blogging daily will help me organise my thoughts.

You can read my short [professional bio](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ugjrQilujrHQHra2mukwEu62JBzImugWP67SBETUSE/edit?usp=sharing), or about my role as a [mathbassador](http://choosemaths.org.au/charles-gray/), for which we made a [short film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0Rqz8Hgacc&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=AMSITubn).
