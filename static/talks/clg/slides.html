# Telling stories with R

---
## What do R-users use R for?

R users are **data storytellers**.

We're going to try to cover everything except *Model*.

## egg before the chicken

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Science starts with a question. Data science starts with the data. What makes data science so hard is that it starts in the wrong place. &lt;a href="https://t.co/AQKbPCCtC2"&gt;https://t.co/AQKbPCCtC2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Roger D.

&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


To be data detectives, we'll need some data.

## A fitting dataset

To familiarise ourselves with R, we will do what R users do.

We will explore a dataset.

A **fitting** dataset. 

A few images to explain why a dataset about witch trials might be appropriate for a workshop hosted by an advocacy group for underrepresented genders.

### A fitting dataset

The inspiration for this presentation was an [analysis](http://rex-analytics.com/witch-hunting-europe-discovery-missingness/) by Steph de Silva, of [useR! 2018](https://user2018.r-project.org/blog/2018/05/30/interview-with-steph-de-silva/) keynote renown.

# Questions, questions that need answering

---
## What would you like to know?

What *data* do we have available?




&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="https://alloftheones.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/ezgif-save.gif" style="width:60%"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

---
## How to answer these questions?

For *this* workshop:

- [language](https://www.r-project.org/): R
- [Integrated development environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment): RStudio

### Why these tools?

- R was intentionally developed to be a data analysis language (aeroplane) 
- RStudio is designed to help users use R (airport)

"The plane is pretty boring without the airport around it."

(Tip of the hat to Julia Lowndes for the aeroplane analogy.)

# Installation hell

---
## Installation overview

- install R
- install RStudio 

Installation instructions [adapted](https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_london/blob/master/2016-04_Beginners_DropIn/April_DropIn.Rmd) with appreciation from a previous workshop. 

---
## Install R on Mac or Windows

Go to the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/)(CRAN) website.

It was first in a google search for 'cran' in June 2018.

---

### For Mac users

- Click on **Download R for (Mac) OS X** 
- Look at the top link under **Latest release**, which at time of writing is **R-3.5.0.pkg**, and download this if compatible with your current version mac OS (Mavericks 10.9 or higher). Otherwise download the version beneath it which is compatible for older mac OS versions. 

### For Windows users

- Click on **Download R for Windows** 
- Then click on the link **install R for the first time** 
- Download from the large link at the top of the page which at time of writing is **Download R 3.5.0 for Windows**. 

---
## Install R

- Then double click the downloaded **R-3.5.0.pkg** file and follow the prompts to install the downloaded software.

---
## Download &amp; Install RStudio:

Go to the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) website.  

It was first in a google search for 'rstudio' in June 2018.

Choose **RStudio** and scroll down to the blue **Download RStudio Desktop** button. 

Click the green button to download **RStudio Desktop Open Source License** and select appropriate installer for your operating system.

Double click the installer and follow the prompts to set up RStudio. 

---
## Why RStudio?

Working in an RStudio [project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) has **many** benefits.

- Free, open source software R in an IDE
- Reproducible workflows
- Streamlined workflow, project to package

---
class: inverse, bottom, left
# Getting started in RStudio

---
## Create a project

- Open RStudio and create a project via **File-New Project**
- Select **New Directory** and choose **New Project**
- Name your project **rcurious**
- Save the project directory wherever suits you


---
## Argh, so many windows

Let's start with a couple useful panes.

- Console
- Environment

### Cheat sheet

**Help-Cheatsheets-RStudio IDE Cheatsheet** 

---
class: inverse, bottom, left
# How to run code?!

---

## Pseudo code

So that you have the experience of getting your hands dirty with code, we'll use pseudo code.

```{}
&lt;this is pseudo code&gt;

install.packages("&lt;write code here&gt;")


```

If I wanted to install a package called `metafor`, I would use the code

```{}
install.packages("metafor")
```

Notice that we drop the `&lt;&gt;`. That's not code, it's *pseudo code* to highlight where your input is.

---

## Running code in the Console

The console is where you can execute single-line R commands.

The console is located, by default, in the lower left pane. 

### code it, grrl

Try `3 + 2` in the Console pane and press **enter**.

---

## Environment

I can store the number 5 in an *object* `x`. To assign a value we use an arrow `&lt;-`.


```r
# Say, if I wanted to store the character string 
"the cake is a lie" 
```

```
## [1] "the cake is a lie"
```

```r
# in a variable called cake. 

# show me the cake
```

### code it, grrl

If I assign the value 5 to the *object* `x`, and call it in the console, it returns the value assigned.


```r
# Assign 5 to x and call x.
```

There are many complex data types in R.

---

## Data structures in R

Data *objects* can be made of

- numbers
- characters "this is a character string"
- logicals (TRUE/FALSE) 
- list (mixed)

Or tables of combinations of the above.


```
##   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
## 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
```


And much more.

---

The witch trials dataset is a table.

It is a [*tidy*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) data structure:

- rows are *observations*
- columns are *variables* (attributes)

---

## Editor

We'll do this analysis in R markdown.

- run code in *chunks*
- write in text, LaTeX, html, outside of code chunks 
- make websites, presentations, books 

---
class: bottom, center, inverse

# Rmarkdown

---

## Opening an .Rmd

Open **File-New File-R Markdown** 

Follow the prompts to install the required *packages*.  

Give your document a title and press **ok**.

This will open an *untitled* template. 

Save your document - note, you have given your document a title, not saved it!

Press the wheel next to the **knit** icon at the top of the Editor pane and select Viewer.

Now we will *knit* our document.

---

## The tutorial document

A treasure trove! 

---
## Presentations to notes
 
**control + shift + k** to knit

But it is annoying having a pop out window, so let's view these notes in the Viewer pane.

We are going to modify the YAML at the top of the document so that you can see how to toggle a presentation into notes. 

Press the little **document outline** button in the top right corner of the Editor pane, and navigate to the top of the document.

```
output :
  # ioslides_presentation 
  html_document: 
     toc: true
     toc_float: true
```

Knit again. (This can take a while.) 

---

### code it, grrl

Navigate to this section in the Editor pane by using the **Document Outline** provided by the button in the top right of the Editor.



--### code it, grrl

Let's create a section called **cats**.

- To create a heading use `#`. The more `###`, the smaller the heading.

becomes 

## cats are awesome


```r
# add heading here "cats" 
```

Somewhat confusingly, comments in R are indicated with a single `#`.


---
We can add bullet points with  `-`. So,

```
- Euclid
- Beanie
- Patches
```

renders in your output like this:

- Euclid
- Beanie


### code it, grrl


```r
# add Patches' name to the list
```

### Cheatsheet

You can make tables, insert images and videos, and much more! 

There are two cheatsheets on RMarkdown in **Help-Cheatsheets**. 
### 

Knit your document and bask in the pretty!

# Packages

---

## Packages

Packages are collections of other people's code.

Often someone has already written a script that does what you want to do.

For example, we want to import the witch trials data. We will use a package that helps with data wrangling tasks like this, the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/). 

We're going to use the metapackage `tidyverse` to help us with our data analysis. 

---

## Functions

The most common element of packages are functions. R also comes preloaded with a *base* of functions commonly used. 

Functions run other people's code for us, so that we don't have to reinvent the wheel. 
We will use functions to intall and load the `tidyverse`.

### How to spot a function

- *functions* in R take the form `&lt;function()&gt;`

### Getting more information 

To learn more about a function, type `?function` into the Console, and the Help pane will display documentation. 

---

## Installing packages

We want to install the package `tidyverse`.

Take a look at the help documentation for the function `install.packages()`.

### installation
`install.packages("&lt;name of package&gt;")`

NB: packages only need to be installed once.

---
## Using packages

`library(&lt;name of package&gt;)`

### code it, grrl

We would like to install and use a package called "tidyverse". 

Let's try. 

I already have `tidyverse` installed. What happens if I try to load a package I haven't installed yet? 


```r
# load tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

# try loading a package that hasn't been installed at the console 
```

---
class: bottom, left, inverse

# Importing data

---

## Import the witch trials data

Since the data is stored on an online repository, we can import it via url. 

We can import this data using the `read_csv()` function from the `tidyverse`. 

**This function takes one argument, the url, which goes between the () as a "character string".**   

There are many types file types, which often need special care. 

---
## code it, grrl

The data is found here: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JakeRuss/witch-trials/master/data/trials.csv"

Try importing the data at the console with `read_csv`. 

```{}
read_csv(&lt;"my_url"&gt;)
```



```r
# import data with readr::read_csv
```


`read_csv` with the argument url produces a data object. An object we can assign.

Open a code chunk *here* and read the data in using `read_csv` and assign `&lt;-` the data to an object called `witchdat`

- **control+alt+i** to open a code chunk. 
- press green **play** to run chunk.

# Exploratory data analysis

---
## Exploratory data analysis

Let's explore the information in this table.

- summary
- wrangling and cleaning 
- visualisation

---
## Summary functions

Lots of objects in R `&lt;an R object&gt;` are friendly to the `summary(&lt;an R object&gt;)` function. We're going to use a fancy summary function that gives nice histograms. 

```{}
skimr::skim(&lt;a dataset&gt;)
```

### code it, grrl

- Open a code chunk here and load the `skimr` package in your notes
- apply the `skim` function to the `witchdat` data



---
## Informed questions

*Based on this new information, what questions do we add or update?*

At this point, we often wish to manipulate the data in some way. 

This is variously known as wrangling, cleaning, and scrubbing.

# Data wrangling

---
## The fine art of wrangling

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="http://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2016-03-15-dark-side-of-science-meme.jpg" style="width:80%"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

---
## Change the name of a variable

This presentation is inspired by Steph de Silva's wonderful [analysis](http://rex-analytics.com/witch-hunting-europe-discovery-missingness/) *Witch Hunting in Europe: a discovery of missingness*.

One of the first things that Steph does is change the name of the column `gadm.adm0` to something more human-interpretable, `country`.

Steph notes, 
&gt; "This is a gross oversimplification of geography in the middle ages of Europe, but it describes the location of the trial in terms that will be most familiar to many modern users."

---
## Follow in the footsteps of greatness

Let's use the `rename()` function to change the name of the variable (column) `gadm.adm0` to `country`.

To do this, we'll learn a very useful *operator*, the pipe ` %&gt;% `. 

---
## The pipe

Piping makes code easier to read (arguably).  

For example, we saw a snapshot of the preloaded iris data earlier.

The `head()` function takes one argument, a table: 

```{}
head(&lt;some data table&gt;). 
```

But we could also *pipe* `%&gt;%` the data into the function.

```{}
&lt;some data table&gt; %&gt;% head() 
```

---
## code it, grrl

Use the pipe operator and the `head` function to present the top of the `witchdat` dataset. 


```r
# head function applied to witchdat

# head function with pipe applied to witchdat
```

---
## Rename a column

We can rename a column by constructing a pipe from the table to the `rename` function
```{}
&lt;my data&gt; %&gt;% 
  rename(&lt;newname&gt; = &lt;oldname&gt;)
```

### code it, grrl

Pipe `witchdat` to the `rename` function and change `gadm.adm0` to `country`. 




---

# Visualisation

---
## The structure of a ggplot

The tidy way of plotting data is with the `ggplot2` package, which comes with the `tidyverse`.

```{}
&lt;some data&gt; %&gt;% # pipe the data to ggplot()


```


### code it, grrl

What happens when we `%&gt;%` the `witchdat` table into `ggplot()`?

---
## Aesthetics

We define x and y axes of the plot with aesthetics in `ggplot`.

```{}
&lt;some data&gt; %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = &lt;column name&gt;, y = &lt;column name&gt;))
```

### code it, grrl

What happens if we set x and y axes to column names in `aes`? 

---
## code it, grrl: my first ggplot

Let's see how many women were murdered as witches over time.  

We'll add a plot layer `+` to our ggplot using `geom_point` for a scatterplot. 

Set the x axis to *year* and the y axis to *deaths*.

```{}
&lt;data&gt; %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = &lt;column with year&gt;, y = &lt;column with deaths&gt;)) +
  geom_point() # Adds a scatterplot.
```





---
## leaflet demo



```r
leaflet::leaflet() %&gt;%
  leaflet::addTiles() %&gt;%
  leaflet::addCircles(data = witchdat,
                      lng = ~ lon,
                      lat = ~ lat)
```

## The rstats community is the best

I thought you might be interested in a conversation I had while preparing this workshop. The [rstats community](https://community.rstudio.com/) is your best resource.

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;How to teach R to students so they make enough autonomous cognitive links to take more away from the experience than simply successfully running the example? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/samclifford?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@samclifford&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MilesMcBain?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@MilesMcBain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thejholloway?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@thejholloway&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/visnut?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@visnut&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/PlNt3M0xY3"&gt;https://t.co/PlNt3M0xY3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Charles T.
