<h2>what the power law?</h2>
<p>A functional relationship between two quantities where a relative change in one results in a proportional change in the other. Mathematically, given a relation <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = ax^{-k}\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
f(cx) = a(cx)^{-k} = c^{-k}f(x) \\prop f(x)
\]</span></p>
